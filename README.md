# Project 02 -  Using machine learning for cryptocurrency analysis

Our project is to predict future closing price for bitcoin data from kaggle[1]. We will fit neural network LSTM  algorithm  and 
other other simpler algorithm to create a predictive model. We will then compare the performance of all models to termine which 
has better predictive power
